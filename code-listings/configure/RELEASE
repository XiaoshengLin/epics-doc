# RELEASE file(s) should contain only definitions
# of EPICS module locations.
# The order of definitions determines the search order
# for headers, libraries, and associated files.
# EPICS_BASE appears last so other apps can override stuff:

# These examples require only EPICS Base.
# Create configure/RELEASE.local and add a definition
# of "EPICS_BASE" like the following.
#EPICS_BASE=/usr/lib/epics


# Create this file and place module locations
-include $(TOP)/configure/RELEASE.local
